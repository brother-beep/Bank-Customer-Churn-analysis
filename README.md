# Bank-Customer-Churn-analysis
Bank Churn Analysis and Predictive modeling
Bank customer churn refers to the phenomenon of customers ending their relationship with a bank and taking their business elsewhere. Churn analysis involves analyzing various factors to identify customers who are at a higher risk of churning. This analysis helps banks understand the reasons behind customer attrition and take proactive steps to retain valuable customers. By leveraging techniques such as data mining and machine learning, banks can predict churn and implement targeted retention strategies. Ultimately, effective churn management enables banks to maintain customer loyalty, reduce revenue loss, and drive long-term profitability.

Major features in our dataset
CreditScore— A customer with a higher credit score is less likely to leave the bank.

In this project, we have done some exploratory data analysis using a dataset on customer leaving the service of the bank.The reasonable features are provided there. We have made a machine learning model to predict weather a customer left the service or not and found the model accuracy on testing set about 99.8% in case of MLPClassifer model.Other model performances are also good.
